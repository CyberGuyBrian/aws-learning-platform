## 🎯 What Was Built

- ✅ Built a complete AWS certification platform with **20 core topics** and **100+ key concepts**
- 🧠 Developed a **150-question Master Quiz System** with randomized question pools
- 🔒 Integrated **anti-cheat mechanisms** and secure logic barriers
- 🕹️ Created **3 Boss Projects** simulating real-world AWS security & deployment scenarios
- 🎮 Designed a **cybersecurity-inspired, gamified user interface**
- 📈 Implemented a structured, progressive learning methodology

## 🧪 Boss Projects

Each Boss Project simulates a complex real-world AWS challenge:

1. **AWS SOC Simulation** – Monitor and respond to incidents using IAM logs
2. **Cloud Infrastructure Setup** – Design and deploy a full-stack VPC environment
3. **Serverless Threat Detection** – Build Lambda-triggered automation to detect & report anomalies

---

## 📚 Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Radix UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, GitHub OAuth, API security
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **DevOps Concepts**: IAM, VPC, Lambda, CloudTrail, S3, EC2
- **UX**: Gamification, learning progress tracking, mobile-first design
- **Security**: Secure login, anti-cheat logic, data sanitization

## 🧠 How It Works

### Learning Workflow:
1. Choose a topic (e.g., IAM, EC2)
2. Review flashcards or notes
3. Take mini quizzes
4. Advance through Master Quiz
5. Complete Boss Project

Progress is saved client-side or via OAuth.
